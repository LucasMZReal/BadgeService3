BadgeService3 allows you to have free badges using your own data saving mechanism!

## Why use BadgeService3?
BadgeService3 is a profile-based module which allows you to have free badges, with notifications, and everything you need. Unlike some other options, it allows you to connect it to other datastoring modules, or mechanics. You can ue it for example, with [DataStore2](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/Roblox/tree/master/DataStore2), or [ProfileService](https://github.com/MadStudioRoblox/ProfileService), and many others, or just simple-old normal datastores.

## Why BadgeService"3"?

In the past I had created a module called BadgeService2, which was a really simple module which just cached BadgeService results allowing for faster read, however, after some time, I created BadgeService3, which is about free badges. Which was later turned into this v2, and yes, this is a v2.

## But WHY use it? Why do I need free badges?

They can be used as normal badges, or to migrate later to actual badges. It woudn't be hard to do so either. It allows you to easily keep, and also create an illusion that someone got a badge, when did they didn't. For example, if you want to have an event, and keep a badge to the people who participated, you can do that with BadgeService3. Later on, you can create an actual badge for it.
